      This web app has two parts - <strong>Weapon Detection</strong> and <strong>People Counter</strong>.
      <br>
      <br>
      With <strong>Weapon Detection</strong>, we can detect weapons such as handguns, rifles, pistols, knives, machine guns and sniper rifles in both photos and videos. The weapons are indicated by bounding boxes drawn around them in bright colours for easy detection and visibility.

    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      The <strong>People Counter</strong> mode detects the number of people present in an image and displays the count. In videos, this mode draws a line across the screen, actively tracks the moving people, analyses their direction and accordingly keeps a count of the number of people crossing the line in both upward and downward direction.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="text-center">USES</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">
      <br>
      The <strong>Weapon Detection</strong> feature can be used to filter out images containing dangerous weapons in social media, particularly to detect content involving guns usually flagged as NSFW. The video detection feature can also be integrated with existing CCTV surveillance systems to detect weapons in real-time. A notification system can alert the members of the surveillance team even if they miss anything suspicious when manually inspecting the video feed.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      This will significantly reduce the response time in dangerous scenarios involving weapons, particularly in sensitive installations like airports, nuclear power plants, dams, space centres, etc. Public places like railway stations, bus terminuses, amusement parks, malls and exhibition centres can also use our solution to upgrade their existing security setups. Beneficiaries also include companies providing security solutions as now they'll be able to lessen the number of human resources allocated on each project and rely on the real-time detection system to zero down on threats. This feature will be helpful for the human operators too as the system would take a lot of burden off their shoulders and they would be able to work longer hours without feeling fatigued or stressed.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify">
      The <strong>People Counter</strong> feature too has diverse uses. This feature, when implemented in existing CCTV systems can be put to several uses depending upon the industry it is implemented in. Our app can find application in mass gatherings of people of the scale of Kumbh Mela or Hajj to ensure proper crowd control. Unfortunate incidents like stampedes are not unknown in such gatherings where the number of devotees number in millions. Of course, to implement our app on such a large scale would require strong coordination between all the feeds and robust software that'll able to process so much data.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify">
      The <strong>tracking feature</strong> included in the app can also be optimised to effectively indicate instances of unnecessary loitering especially in areas which are exposed to security threats. ATMs, airports, warehouses, museums and railway stations can particularly make great use of this to prevent possible crimes. If the algorithm detects loitering in an area, it can issue a notification to the security operators inspecting the video footage. There can be different levels of notifications which be trigger based on how much time a person loiters in that area. This will help draw attention quickly to the necessary parts as human error can always creep in, especially when the operators are watching several surveillance feeds at once.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify">
      The <strong>counting feature</strong> can also be installed outside the door of a room, auditorium or a cinema hall to get an accurate count of people inside it. This feature, if implemented smartly, can also be used to monitor one-way corridors in sensitive installations where movement in only one way is permitted. Violating the specified direction would instantly alert the operators. This can be very helpful in the early detection of breaches inside a building or a facility. The counting feature can also be coupled with smart air-conditioning systems which operate at different levels of power with respect to the number of people inside a hall, etc. This can help a lot in the overall energy savings of a facility. These savings can be significant when analysed on a long-term basis. The counting feature can also be used in public spaces like concert halls, sports stadiums, music festivals, etc. where the footfall figures can be accurately found out. The cameras in the entry/exit gates if equipped with this feature can help achieve this.

      This is a small working prototype or rather a humble effort in this direction. With constant guidance and relentless mentoring, we ernestly believe that we would be able to develop this project into a valuable product so that we can commercialise and capitalise on the endless benefits it'll offer and help make the world a safer place.
